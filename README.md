a psd map with (hopefully) up-to-date all Anemoculus &amp; Geoculus on it; toggleable with layers in Photoshop, or you can just use MS Paint to cross them out one by one.

## Why? / How is this repo born?

I want all the Anemoculus and Geoculus.

I found an interactive one on CN mihoyo bbs [here](https://bbs.mihoyo.com/ys/obc/content/1060/detail?bbs_presentation_style=no_header), which I recommend anyone reading this give it a try; it might just suit your needs better than this repo.

However, I want to cross out each of them after I get them, while the interactive version does not allow this. (Actually, you can by deleting the elements named 'leaflet-marker-icon mhy-game-gis-marker' one by one as you progress in your browser's inspector, but every time you do a refresh / close, you have to start over.)

I also really like charting these things in open-world games.
